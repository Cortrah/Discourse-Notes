# Discourse Workshop

This book is half owners manual and half reference guide for the Discourse open source forum software.

## Why Discourse?
I've been developing client side software for twenty years now. I've tried a number of times to delve into the server side, but there are a lot of different concerns on the server side than what I'm used to. And I've been pretty disappointed with the quality of instructional materials on how to write server side software. Most material tends to be tutorials that regurgitate toy examples that don't deal with real usability, testing, security, database design, caching, hosting or maintenance in any useful way. Faced with that continual disappointment, I decided to go back to the basics and find some source code to read.

Discourse is a real world, well engineered, 100% open source project that attempts to address some high level problems with online discussion. They have good tests, database and both client and server software that is written with modern practices. It certainly has it's flaws and technical or historical baggage as anything does. But I think that if I get to know this code intimately, warts and all, I'll learn something real.
