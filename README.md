# Discourse Workshop

This book is half owners manual and half reference guide for the Discourse open source forum software.

## Why Discourse?
I've been developing client side software for twenty years now. I've tried a number of times to delve into server side software, but there are a lot of different concerns on the server side than what I'm used to. And I've been soundly disappointed with the quality of instructional materials on how to write real world server side software. Applications are often toys that don't deal with testing, security, database design, caching, hosting or maintenance in any useful way. 

Discourse is a real world, well engineered 100% open source project that attempts to address some high level problems with online discussion. They have good tests, a real world database and both client and server software written with modern practices.
